// C# for loop
When u know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop.

// for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3)
// {
  // code block to be executed
// }
 // Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
 // statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
 // statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
 
 /* using System;
 namespace MyApplication
 {
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      for (int i = ; i < 5; i++)
        Console.WriteLine(i);
      }
    }
  }
} */
