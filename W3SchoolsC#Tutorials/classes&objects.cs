// Everything in C# is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.

// A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

/*
class Car
{
  string color = "red";
}
*/

// Create an Object

/*
using System;
namespace MyApplication
{
  class Car
  {
    string color - "red";
    
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Car myobj = new Car();
      Console.WriteLine(myObj.color);
    }
  }
}
*/

//Using Multiple Classes

//prog.cs
/*
using System;
namespace MyApplication
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Car myObj = new Car();
      Console.WriteLine(myObj.color);
    }
  }
}
*/

// Prog2.cs

/*
using System;
namespace MyApplication
{
  class Car
  {
    public string color = "red";
  }
}
*/
